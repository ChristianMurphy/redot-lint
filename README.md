# redotlint

redot-lint is a graphviz code style linter. Another linter? Yes. Ensuring the graphviz you (and contributors) write is of great quality will provide better rendering in all the different graphviz parsers, and makes sure less refactoring is needed afterwards.

What is quality? Thatâ€™s up to you, but there are sensible presets.

redot-lint is built on redot, a powerful graphviz processor powered by plugins (such as this one).
